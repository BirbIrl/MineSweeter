# VoidSweeper - MineSweeper meets Anxiety
This project was meant to be a relaxing minesweeper clone that goes on endlessly for all your zen needs

That it is not.

tldr you race against a growing void on a minesweeper board. The more tiles you reveal the more the void speeds up.

this is a finished gameplay prototype, do with it whatever you want :D
